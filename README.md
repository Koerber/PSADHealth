# PS-ADHealth

## Overview
This project is a toolkit of AD specific health checks that you can run in your environment to ensure your Active Directory is running optimally.

## History
This toolkit was born from a chapter Mike Kanakos wrote for the PowerShell Conference Book. The toolkit is the logical progression from that chapter. 

## What does this toolkit do?
The toolkit is a work in progress but essentially it is a series of functions and scripts that are purpose built. Each tool in the kit is meant to check a particular aspect of Active Directory and return a result. 

These scripts are built by a group of individuals who recognized that the monitoring tools in their org's were either not able to perform these tests or the tools that could were too expensive to purchase. They created their own tools and collaborated to make a toolkit of unique, yet useful functions to help them keep better tabs on their AD infrastructure.

## Who is this for? 
These toolkit is meant to be used by anyone!
Maybe your org has no monitoring tools, maybe your looking to fill some gaps, or maybe you you have lost faith in the tools currently in use at your org. 

These tools are here for **you**!
